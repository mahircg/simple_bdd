Setup

The following instruction applies if intended to build a minimal BDD package in C++, that implements the fundamental manipulation methods for ROBDDS.

Assumptions:
* run on linux machine.
* have scons installed.
* have CppUnit installed.

1.Build of static library

* Hierarchical scons is used, at root directory there is an SConstruct which is looked by scons at beginning.
* For each folder there is a SConscript defining how the code should be handled for compilation purposes.
* Nested script calls are performed to cover all required folders.
* To compile on the console in the root directory type: "scons".
* To build on the console in the root directory type: "scons build".
* To clean files produces during compilation type: "scons -c".
* To compile and run the tests type: "scons test".

2. Documentation

* Doxygen is used to generate automatically documentation from comments included in the code.
* In the directory "/doc" check configuration file "doxyConfigEx" to configure the desired values. Configuration file is well documented.
* To run doxygen type on console from "/doc" folder: "doxygen doxyConfigEx".

3. Testing

* To perform uni testing testing framework CppUnit is used.
* Code for unit testing is located in "/src/unittest", code defines the tests.
* Code to execute the unit tests is located in "/test/testrunner.cpp".
